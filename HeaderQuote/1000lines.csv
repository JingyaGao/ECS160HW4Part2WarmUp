brenduch,@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving have to wait
VahidESQ,@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on tell me it's coming then not.
brenduch,@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
CRomerDome,@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
JustOGG,@united link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.

HelloKansas,@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..

mrs_laurelanne,@SouthwestAir thanks got put on the am flight tomorrow.  Don't have much faith it'll get off the ground tomorrow though.

joelraronoff,@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
liquidfox1,@USAirways me too. In the future have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed

DaintyKenyan,@USAirways I was supposed to be on flight 1861 from Charlotte to RDU @ 8:20pm yesterday. Is the same flight scheduled for departure tonight?

AndrewBarco1,@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
gczark,@JetBlue I normally ‚ù§Ô∏è you but this Late Flightst flight experience was the worst. 2 hours on runway no wifi &amp; tv not working properly
OnyxMediagroup1,@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
clarelanusse,@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
jupiterjpr,@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
zachupton,@USAirways unfortunately not. I think I watched it take off from the bus. Rebooked for a Late Flightr flight now #planestrainsandautomobiles
clarelanusse,@SouthwestAir good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well

MBinMD,@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
EasyEdmund,@JetBlue just learning about your famous apology in social media marketing. Is Twitter an asset for Jet Blue now? @PhD_Mama_
RBrandtPhoto,@SouthwestAir Just sent you a DM with the details.
CWWMUK,@united No not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam
leahennessy,@SouthwestAir please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx
Dazoulai,@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
gczark,@JetBlue hard to tell but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane.
jmacie3,@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
joshgrider,@SouthwestAir got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out!
DGomezPearlberg,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
realMattHolt,@SouthwestAir chances of flight leaving BNA tomorrow at 6:20 am (to LGA)?
TexanHollie,@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
paulhting,@virginamerica Any way to change from Main Cabin to Main Cabin Select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty?
TexanHollie,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
thodge77,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
izzyflan,@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2 baggage in NC?
thodge77,@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
DGomezPearlberg,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
thodge77,@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
rizolltizide,@united who can tell me where they are?
j_husucks,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
Clagett,@JetBlue 2:55 tomorrow from RIC to BOS. Looking good or am I better rescheduling?
DrewRHacker,@JetBlue Thank you that it is not just a livery; it is a culture that 16000+ crewmembers embody daily #thanksDave http://t.co/iNNP0Kkyby
JenniesMagic,@USAirways done
rkasold,@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
Gomeziz,@SouthwestAir  Tried to DM you it won't let me as it says you are not following me.
j_husucks,@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
j_husucks,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys (2/2) and another sent him to the wrong line...oh and the kiosks weren't working! #thanks
mtmridesbikes,@JetBlue rocking the Tim McGraw hold music

paulhting,@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
famousswan,@SouthwestAir I got a flight at 11:55am on Thursday but looking for something tomorrow anything available?
TomVH,@SouthwestAir right but the point was that my kids don't fly often but I do. I bought four round trip tickets from DtW to PHX so I'm....
LyndsaySignor,@JetBlue Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
TomVH,@SouthwestAir missing out on over 6000 points in one account. They're now spread over four assuming I create accounts for them
thodge77,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
RWMann,@united Thanks ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class.
LyndsaySignor,@JetBlue i'm getting info from the website but needing to check it and the alerts would be much more beneficial.
thodge77,@united flt 4567 no gate agent no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
jdpletnick,@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
famousswan,@SouthwestAir from LGA to San Diego
_JoeChuck,@USAirways on hold for 2 hours. You know what just keep my money
travelingranger,@JetBlue heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore!
ShiraJudah,@JetBlue @KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a
patpohler,@SouthwestAir thanks I think we've got it figured out
bdhatch1,@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to BNA. I have flight from BNA 2 MDW tomorrow AM. You stranded me in DEN. I've been on hold all day
ShiraJudah,@JetBlue @KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn't help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should
ShiraJudah,@JetBlue @KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it
cayocrazy,@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
DC_Geoff,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
LyndsaySignor,@JetBlue Great thanks

caralageson,@SouthwestAir where do we start? I've already wasted 1.5 hrs of phone wait time already :-(
amorris1116,@USAirways can you please DM me my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm
