nesi_1992,@JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ #nothappy
CPoutloud,@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
brenduch,@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving have to wait
VahidESQ,@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on tell me it's coming then not.
brenduch,@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
CRomerDome,@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
JustOGG,@united link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
mrshossruns,@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
feliciastoler,@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
markhlyon,Wanted to get my bag benefit but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card MP Visa is only option. @united
DBsViewOnThings,@united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
ljsbrooks,@united still waiting for a reply
gwaki,@united even though technically after I land I will be silver?

followkashyap,@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.

twinkletaters,@JetBlue Thanks! Her flight leaves at 2 but she's arriving to the airport early. Wedding is in VT in Sept. Grateful you fly to BTV!! :)
MiKasuga,@United is officially the worst most delayed and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on
WorkingWify,@SouthwestAir won't answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone
DonnyYardas,@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh ðŸ˜•
TravellerLukose,@JetBlue No worries. Delay was minor and dealt with nicely. It was captain of flight 2324 by the way.
Tinygami,@SouthwestAir Is it a temporary site glitch or are you no longer offering flights from GRR to GEG after Feb? Can't find any online :(

MMKuderka,@SouthwestAir allows other passengers 2 harass u after their gate agents mistakeFURIOUS they are doing NOTHING about it &amp; my 6yo was scared
kabell87,@SouthwestAir  this is really unhelpful. Why can't I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i
EBlaikie,@JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
elowthers,@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
MarkKersten,.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
scherzva,@united New Apple crÃ¢pe amazing! Live from UA1207. Really nice crew too.  #AmericanAir has biscuits UA needs them 2 http://t.co/gZ9GqDT7Jj
lucasdavidson,@SouthwestAir on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home.
wackydunks,.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
Raven_TheGreat,@SouthwestAir why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH
